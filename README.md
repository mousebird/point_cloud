Point Cloud Support for WhirlyGlobe-Maply

This project uses the large file storage from github:
https://git-lfs.github.com/

The test data file is stored there, so you’ll need to install that package, or go get it manually.

You’ll need the external libraries.  First, start with the submodules:
- git submodule init
- git submodule update

Then you’ll need the binary libraries I’ve put on dropbox:
[url]

Extract that into the libs directory.

Then you should be able to build.  Let me know if you run into problems:  sjg@mousebirdconsulting.com
